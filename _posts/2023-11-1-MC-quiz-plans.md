# Quiz Plans: 

## Pseudo Code + More
- Overview the general purpose and how it functions
- How its similar/different from python
- Practice using pseudo code at study.com
- Look back at team teaches
- Take other practice quizzes
- Take a look at previous exams and understand structure

## Troubles: 
- Procedures
- Simulations
- Concavity

## Results: 
55/66 = 83.33333%

## Corrections + Reflection
Overall, I am happy with the score I got since I understood, and answered 80% of the questions correctly. Below I will list the questions I got wrong with the right answer provided. 

### Question 11: 
Answered: B
Correct answer: D
The two options are identical except B is divided into 1, 3 meaning each spin there's a 1/3 chance of getting a specific color while D represents 1, 6 or 1/6 chance of spinning a specific color. 
<br>

### Question 22: 
Answered: D
Correct answer: B
Instead of it being total > 0.5 (counter) which will always be true, it had to be counter > 0.5 (total)
<br>

### Question 23: 
Answered: A
Correct answer: B
Model A is a square where to get to S the function can just go from P -> Q -> S or P -> R -> S, the right model displays only one possible solution; P -> R -> Q -> S
<br>

### Question 28: 
Answered: C (7)
Correct Answer D (8)
Accidentally misclicked, but right answer is 8 because 2^8 is over 200 while 2^7 is not. 
<br>

### Question 30: 
Answered: B (2 hours)
Correct answer: D (5 hours)
The reason why its D is because each call to the Analysis procedure requires one hour of program execution time. It executes once inside the loop and 4 times outside the loop therefore 5 hours is the right answer. 
<br>

### Question 36: 
Answered: A (Overflow error occured)
Correct answer: B (float-pointint presentation)
The right answer is B because the fixed number of bits used to represent real numbers limits range of floating-point values. 
<br>

### Question 37: 
Answered: B (2 displays right 1 does not)
Correct answer: C (both display the correct answer)
They both work, 1 just requires more arithmetic operations
<br>

### Question 38: 
Answered: A (count/10=0)
Correct answer: C (count MOD 10 = 0)
C is correct because because it evaluates true when count is multiple of 10. 
<br>

### Question 51: 
Answered: Skipped Accidentally
Correct Answer: B (develop a system that matches each letter)
B is right because its a symmetric encription since the secret key is used for both encryptive and decryptive messages. 
<br>

### Question 57: 
Answered: A (returns Huppy)
Correct answer: B (returns Happy)
The expression concatenates first two letters of Harp with last three letters of Puppy resulting in happy. 
<br>

### Question 58: 
Answered: A (1, 2, 3)
Correct Answer: (1,2 only)
Option 3 does not work since some of the problems aren't solvable on time.
