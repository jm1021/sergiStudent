- Learned a lot of Pseudo Code
- Learned a lot of Python
- Learned some things about javascript
- Practiced CSS/JS as the frontend developer
- Was able to help out on backend
- Created my first working project ever :DDD
- Passion project turned out well (I liked it)
- Learned to collaborate

## Troubles: 
- A lot of errors that slowed down the process
- Error 1 (multiple times)
- Not everyone always worked on what they were supposed to
- Trouble understanding directions (being a little behind)
- Issues linking backend and frontend
- Our group didn't think too much ahead; we should have. 


## Goals/Plans:

- Maybe try a different role next tri (backend or scrum master/dev ops)
- Try something new for my project, make a game maybe

- Not procrastinate 
- Plan ahead and pay attention in class
- Find a good group that I am comfortable collaborating with!
- Try to push my limits and do something super creative!
