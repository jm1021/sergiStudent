# Individual Review
<br/>

## Contribution: 
[Original Idea](https://ishancornick.github.io/FrontendRepo//2023/10/15/Glass-Frog.html)
- In our original project we were planning to create a python multiplayer game involving different types of frogs.
- I created different tables with 5-6 different frogs resembling the "characters" of the game. We were plannignt to also provide facts apart from having the user enjoy the fun game.
- However, we overlooked it and didn't realize that python games are not able to display on a website. This meant that we had to restart our whole project and now we came up with the idea of a frog API

- This is all of our data for frogs. Originally started in js it's roughly 600 lines of code with information about our 50+ frogs.

**More:**
This is some basic JS Code that I added to our page to make it more interactive. The rain is there because frogs like the rain and the jumping frog is simply a cool addition.

**This is what our website ended up looking like:**

[Key Commit:](https://github.com/IshanCornick/FrontendRepo/commit/ba1c9bed2b5d2d91492be7d2731c453da801c40e)
- The information being the most important part of our project means that the code I just talked about IS the key commit since without it there would have been no data about the frogs, whie the whole point of our project was that it was a frog API/search engine.
