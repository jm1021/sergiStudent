# Individual Review
<br>

## Contribution: 
This is all of our data for frogs. Originally started in js it's roughly 600 lines of code with information about our 50+ frogs.

## More: 
This is some basic JS Code that I added to our page to make it more interactice. The rain is there because frogs like the rain and the jumping frog is simply a cool addition.

## Key Commit: 
The information being the most important part of our project means that the code I just talked about IS the key commit since without it there would have been no data about the frogs, whie the whole point of our project was that it was a frog API/search engine.
