>- Easy for humans to read and write
>- Key value pairs are the fundamental building blocks where data is stored as pairs of keys and values 
<br>

{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "isStudent": true}
<br>

>- It suppports strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null
>- Objects: Enclosed in curly braces {}, represent a collection of key-value pairs

{"person": {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}}
<br>

>- Arrays: Ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets []

{"fruits": ["apple", "banana", "orange"]}
<br>

>- JSON is commonly used to represent structured data, such as user information
