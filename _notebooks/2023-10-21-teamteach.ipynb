    "A file that contains procedures that can be used in a program is called a library. An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. It allows the imported procedures from the library to interact with the rest of your code.\n",
    "<h2>Types of Libraries</h2>\n",
    "There are many types of libraries that modern day companies use, such as Requests, Pillow, Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib. Requests: The Requests library simplifies making HTTP requests in Python, making it easy to interact with web services and retrieve data from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pillow: Pillow is a powerful image processing library for opening, manipulating, and saving various image formats in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas: Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library for efficiently working with structured data, including data import, cleaning, transformation, and analysis in tabular form.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for multidimensional arrays and a wide range of mathematical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn: Scikit-Learn is a machine learning library that offers simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling, including classification, regression, and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework that facilitates deep learning and neural network development, supporting tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library for creating 2D and 3D visualizations and figures in Python, enabling a wide range of plots, charts, and graphs for data visualization and analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are, at their heart, a collection of other people's code, and it would be difficult to understand how the procedures should be used without documentation. APIs explain how two separate pieces of software interact with each other, and they also need documentation to keep this communication going.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Intro to Popcorn Hack 1</h2>\n",
    "We have now hopefully all done or seen this type of question about getting a robot from point a to point b. But this can be very tedious because it may take a lot of code to do that. Luckily, there’s a saving grace called procedures, procedures essentially shorten the amount of code that is needed. So for a robot example we have displayed, we will use the procedure “moveBackwards” to shorten the amount of code we would normally need. This will rotate our triangle 180 degrees. Here is the example and solution\n",
